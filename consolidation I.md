# Introduction 
The first few weeks of this course were immensely interesting - and I did not expect for myself to enjoy them as much as I did. The collection of data from the graveyard of our choice (in my case Beechwood Cemetery) was a first-time experience for me and aided in allowing me to live out my Indiana Jones-esque archaeological fantasies – albeit at a much, much smaller scale.

This course is also my first time being introduced to digital archaeology in a meaningful manner.

However, it wasn’t all smooth sailings. Digital archaeology is a new frontier for me, and new experiences often come hand in hand with new **_hurdles_** - and navigating them at times was both rewarding and frustrating at times.

## Fail
Fails were to be expected, I suppose, when delving into something new. Though not exactly comforting at times (see 'Challenges' for more detail), they were obstacles I needed to overcome nonetheless. Every week or so, I would have ***something*** that didn't go right - creating 3-D models, trouble in satellite imagery for the site sketch, software issues.

The most notable fail out of these "smaller" fails was definitely the trouble I had when creating the 3-D models of the headstones, whose data we had collected. I encountered numerous errors and have yet to figure out a method that works. I have the itching suspicion that it ***MIGHT*** have something to do with the **pictures** I have taken of the headstones themselves, and have already decided on a date to retake them.

## Win
There are not many tangible wins that I believe I can truly give myself for this half of the course. Despite, dipping my toes into a lot of new areas I didn’t necessarily find great success. As evidenced in my weekly logs and journals, every week would another technological hurdle. Such “fails” certainly put a bit of a damper on my motivation, as I would needless apprehension when approaching the “digital” aspect of digital archaeology.

**That being said, if anything else, I believe that I connected well will the more “academic” aspect of the course so far.** The readings so far in the course have been brilliant, and truly have allowed for me to truly get insight into both the nuances and facets of digital archaeology, while also taking a much more “classic article” style approach by outlining the basics of mortuary archaeology. To be more specific, I enjoyed learning about the nuances of familial archaeology – and its relation to pre-mature child death. Now, during my research-conducted visit at Beechwood I came across numerous familial headstones. Now, I belong to a culture in which cremation is an overwhelming commonplace burial practice – hence, I found interesting to see a “material” monument of sorts, erected to memorialize entire generations worth of people.

Furthermore, it was interesting to note the disparity in race and headstone placement, when examining the general plot placements of the Cemetery. Beechwood is a HUGE ground and is just over 160 acres of land. As I drove around the grounds in my car to get a better look of the entire cemetery (and also because I had missed the parking entrance and was forced to go the whole way around, because a 3-point turn isn’t possible on it’s tiny cobblestone streets), I saw how divided the cemetery was in terms of race and ethnicity. There were ENTIRE lots devoted to the burials of certain communities – Asian Communities, Eastern European Communities, and Middle Eastern Europeans. Now, the Beechwood website hails this “inclusion” of different communities as a hallmark of inter-racial relations in regard to burial practice, however one just can ponder how such communities came to be. There is suspiciously no historical reference on Beechwood’s website, neither in any of the written paraphernalia. This prompted me to wonder if any of the “inclusive” communities were rooted in racism and colonialism. Katherine Cook discussed this wonderfully in her article, and I found myself drawing parallels to Beechwood when annotating the text more in-depth.

## Challenges
The biggest challenge for me was definitely getting used to the technological aspect of the course. I used to consider myself pretty tech-savy, however I recall just how overwhelmed I felt during the first of course - as I was downloading and attempting to familiarise myself with the numerous softwares that we had been given in. It was very.... *overwhelming*. There were tutorials given, and both Kavita and Graham were (and still are!) extremely helpful... but there is still this slight intrinsic panic, and I remember during that first week of the course (and subsequent weeks that followed, depending on how tough the tasks for that week were to me) the dread I felt for the rest of the semester. In hindsight, this feeling of dread forced me to recall the words of an old elementary school teacher, who lamented in math class one day how "scared of failure your generation is"; her words ring a bit true now. Because, honestly... that is exactly what I was afraid of. It was ***failure***. I anguished over the thought of trying something new, because I was not certain ***how*** good I would be at it. 

Though it's only been a month and a half into the course, I do feel a small bit of change. I don't get anxious and immediately frustrated when things don't go my way, however, I still have a large boulder to overcome. I do think that the fear of failure is worse than any technological issue or academic problem will ever be me... and if ***nothing else***, I think this course gives me the ample ammunition needed to combat such intellectual and personal insecurities. 

## Implications?
Certainly, there are implications for everything one does. In my case, with the persisting lack of 3-D models, I do not (currently!) have anything "tangible" of the grave sites that examined. It's been mentioned by the isntructors that having the headstones that you've exaxamined "digitized" changes your perspective of the entire ordeal quite a bit... I unfortunately do not have that! 

## Previous Feedback
I had a lot of feedback and affirmations from Dr. Graham regarding both my journals/logs and the work I do outside them.

The last bit of feedback given to me was regarding the 3-D modelling, and the encouragement to use Google Collab to mesh my pictures and I've been making my way through the tutorial instructions on that - it's a bit technologically wordy for me, but I'm getting through it slowly, but surely - in hopes that I ***still manage*** to edge out at least one 3-D model.

## Changes I'm making moving forward
So there is definitely room for improvement! 

Personally, the biggest change comes in regard to how I tackle the Perhaps keeping personal notes on the readings. Annotations are fine, however, I find myself going back and re-tracing my personal thoughts. I think keeping a seperate space will aide in giving me a more personal medium to pour my thoughts on the readings.
